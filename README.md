# Android-Interview-Test

This is a programming skills test for potential Android developers. This project is the skeleton of
an app to display [XKCD comics](https://xkcd.com/). It needs the a few missing parts created to
actually fetch and display comic images.

You may use any 3rd party tools to finish this app, but there are a number of libraries already
included in the project for convenience. Making use of these pre-included libraries is optional:

- Dagger Hilt, with several few classes already bound to the graph
- A networking stack with Retrofit, OkHttp, and Moshi
- Glide image loader
- Android ViewModels, Lifecycle, and LiveData (KTX versions)
- Kotlin Coroutines Android
- RxAndroid 3 (and thus RxJava 3 also)

Feel free to reference outside documentation during the test.

## XKCD's Comic API

XKCD has a [simple API](https://xkcd.com/json.html):

> If you want to fetch comics and metadata automatically,
> you can use the JSON interface. The URLs look like this:
>
> https://xkcd.com/info.0.json (current comic)
>
> or:
>
> https://xkcd.com/614/info.0.json (comic #614)
>
> Those files contain, in a plaintext and easily-parsed format: comic titles,
> URLs, post dates, transcripts (when available), and other metadata.

Here's an example response body:

```json
{
  "month": "3",
  "num": 2437,
  "link": "",
  "year": "2021",
  "news": "",
  "safe_title": "Post-Vaccine Party",
  "transcript": "",
  "alt": "[Future update] Well, someone accidentally dropped an M&M in their cup of ice water, and we all panicked and scattered.",
  "img": "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/post_vaccine_party.png",
  "title": "Post-Vaccine Party",
  "day": "15"
}
```

## Your Task

To begin, make a network call to get the most recent comic, and then display that comic's details
using `ComicFragment`. In the UI, be sure to include:

- The comic's title
- The rendered comic image
- The comic's alt text

This screenshot shows an example of what we're going for:
